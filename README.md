# GFS
The permutation sampling procedure is broken into 3 main parts:
1. The execution file--exec.py.
2. The master file--master.py.
3. The family of distributions files--permute_sample_[norm, logistic, poisson].

1. The exec.py file is called from R. It reads in the inputs from the input.txt
file generated by permute_inputs in R. Datasets are loaded into pandas dataframes
from the paths given: df1_path, df2_path. These objects, along with the formula
string, family, and sampling parameters are passed into the sample function loaded
from master.py.
2. The master.py file contains functions that handle permutations and blocking
in addition to the main sample function. The two datasets along with formula,
family, and sampling parameters are passed to the sample procedure, which first
formats the data by arranging rows by block, adding in extra rows so that blocks
have equal numbers of observations, and combining into one dataframe the columns
referenced in the formula input. Based on the chosen family, the sampling
procedure calls the corresponding sampling function with the combined dataframe,
formula, and sampling parameters. Upon completion of sampling, permutations for
individual blocks are combined into a permutation for the full dataset with
respect to the rows of the first dataset at df1_path.
